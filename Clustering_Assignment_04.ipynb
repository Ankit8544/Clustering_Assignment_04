    "        2. **Spherical Clusters -** It assumes that clusters are roughly spherical in shape and have similar sizes. If clusters are irregularly shaped or vary significantly in size, the DBI may not perform well.\n",

    "**`Yes`, the Silhouette Coefficient can be used to evaluate hierarchical clustering algorithms. The Silhouette Coefficient is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). It ranges from -1 to 1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Compute Clustering -** First, perform hierarchical clustering on your dataset using the chosen algorithm, such as agglomerative clustering or divisive clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Silhouette Coefficient -** For each data point, compute the Silhouette Coefficient. This involves calculating the average distance from the point to other points in the same cluster (a) and the average distance from the point to points in the nearest neighboring cluster (b), and then computing the Silhouette Coefficient using the formula:\n",

    "5. **Compare Results**: We can compare the Silhouette Scores obtained from different hierarchical clustering algorithms or different parameter settings to determine which produces the best clustering solution for your data.\n",

    "While the Silhouette Coefficient is commonly used for evaluating partition-based clustering algorithms, it can also provide insights into the quality of hierarchical clustering results, especially in cases where you need to assess the compactness and separation of clusters. However, it's worth noting that hierarchical clustering might produce varying results depending on the linkage method and distance metric chosen, so it's essential to experiment with different configurations to find the most suitable clustering solution for your data."
